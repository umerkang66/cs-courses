ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest hands-on journey into Machine Learning with JavaScript! ðŸš€

I've built written ML Algorithms from Scratch and created projects with them that demonstrate core ML concepts using JavaScript and TensorFlow.js:

ML Algorithms that i've written in JS:
1) KNN
2) Linear Regression
3) Multiple Linear Regression
4) Binary Logistic Regression
5) Multinomial Logistic Regression

Projects that i've built with my written algorithms in JS:
- K-Nearest Neighbors for house price prediction
- Linear and Logistic Regression models
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
- A fun Plinko game simulation
- Data loading and processing utilities
