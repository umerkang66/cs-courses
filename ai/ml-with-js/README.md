# Machine Learning with JavaScript

This repository contains hands-on projects and code samples for learning and applying machine learning concepts using JavaScript. The projects are designed to help you understand the fundamentals of machine learning, data processing, and model building, all within the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Projects Overview

### 1. KNN with TensorFlow.js (`knn-tf/`)

- **index.js**: Main implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using TensorFlow.js.
- **kc_house_data.csv**: Dataset for house price prediction.
- **load-csv.js**: Utility for loading and parsing CSV data.
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts.

### 2. Plinko Game Simulation (`plinko/`)

- **index.html**: Main HTML file for the Plinko game.
- **score.js**: JavaScript logic for scoring in the Plinko game.
- **lib/**: Contains supporting JavaScript and CSS files.
  - **index.js**: Game logic.
  - **style.css**: Styling for the game.
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts.

### 3. Regressions (`regressions/`)

A collection of regression models implemented in JavaScript:

- **binary-logistic-regression/**: Binary logistic regression implementation.
  - **index.js**: Entry point.
  - **logistic-regression.js**: Model logic.
- **image-recognition/**: Logistic regression for image recognition tasks.
  - **index.js**: Entry point.
  - **logistic-regression.js**: Model logic.
- **linear-regression/**: Linear regression implementation.
  - **index.js**: Entry point.
  - **linear-regression.js**: Model logic.
- **multinominal-logistic-regression/**: Multinomial logistic regression implementation.
  - **index.js**: Entry point.
  - **logistic-regression.js**: Model logic.
- **data/cars.csv**: Sample dataset for regression tasks.
- **load-csv.js**: Utility for loading CSV data.
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umerkang66/cs-courses.git
   cd cs-courses/ai/ml-with-js
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   For each project, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the projects:**
   - For Node.js-based projects, use:
     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```
   - For browser-based projects (like Plinko), open `index.html` in your browser.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (for backend and CLI projects)
- npm (Node package manager)
- Modern web browser (for Plinko game)
